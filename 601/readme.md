# DATA-601-Project
# Dataset: We have used the maryland crashes dataset consisting of three datasets as follows
### Crashes: https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes/65du-s3qu
### Person Details: https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes-Person-Details-/py4c-dicf
### Vehicle Details: https://opendata.maryland.gov/Public-Safety/Maryland-Statewide-Vehicle-Crashes-Vehicle-Details/mhft-5t5y

#	Introduction
In this report we will analyze crashes happening across the state of Maryland mainly from January 2015 through September 2021. The data is explored from the standpoints of time, fatality, location, weather, the vehicles makes and models, license classes and gender. The breakdown of the first four main standpoints is indicated in the following:

1. Time: Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Injury Type and Fatality
2. Fatality: Involving Fixed Objects, Speed Limit, Injury Type, Collision Type
3. Location: Fatality, Road Division
4. Weather: Injury Type, Surface Condition, Road Condition

For each of the main factors that are studied in our report we will give an explanatory data analysis which is described in the following sections. Based on our analysis and our observations we will provide some insights and hypothesize some reasons behind the phenomenon that we have observed. In the end, we will make some suggestions based on explanatory data analysis.


# Conclusion: 

> To summarize the complete analysis, maximum fatal injuries happen in the same direction rear end right turn at speed of 55mph, the state government allocating medical forces nearby these roads could be a way to lessen the chances of Fatal/Incapacitating injuries. It was surprising to see that there are more fatal injuries in Clear Weather in comparison to Severe Winds, however weather wasnâ€™t a major contributing factor to the analysis. From the analysis so far, we are certain that maximum number of accidents happened during the rush hours of 7am-9am and 3pm-5pm, with Fatal accidents been the most during the afternoon. With the pandemic hitting worldwide and people working remotely, there was 20% decrease in the crashes during pandemic.



### Limitation: We have a lot of values for junction codes, weather condition, road condition, surface condition wherever the values are *Not Applicable* - the count of accidents is 3rd largest. There are *Unknown* and *Others* values as well, so we have not considered for our projections. Hence, we are not able to address those collision types.
